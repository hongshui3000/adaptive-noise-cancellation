# Adaptive Noise Calcellation on Xilinx Zedboard

Final project for Advanced Digital Design class implementing adaptive noise cancellation alorithm on Xilinx Zedboard. The board aceepts two microphone inputs: signal contaminated with noise and noise reference signal. LMS algorithm is then run on both inputs to provide a clean signal on the output. Input signal can come either from the board microphone port, or from any other device connected to the board via Ethernet cable.
